Random Quote Generator

This is a random quote generator that was developed as part of the Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree curriculum from Team Treehouse. A random inspirational black history month quote with additional elements will appear on the screen whenever the user clicks the 'show another quote' button. There is also an interval timer that will show another quote and background color every 5 seconds. There is conditional logic to hide elements if the randomly selected quote object does not have that property.
